# Project_Classification

Summary of project and background

The project addresses the challenge of pseudo-labeling in semi-supervised learning by using a multi-class classifier. Traditional binary classifiers using a one-vs-all approach result in class imbalance, increased training time, and larger storage requirements. This project proposes an approach fine-tuning of binary classifiers to train a multi-class classifier, which can predict pseudo-labels accurately, reducing the need for oversampling and lowering computational costs. The approach is validated using the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.
